# Portfolio Folder

This folder is for your artwork and portfolio pieces. Simply drop your image files here and they will automatically appear in your portfolio section on the website.

## Supported Formats
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP
- GIF

## How It Works
1. Add your artwork images to this folder
2. The website will automatically detect and display them
3. Images are randomly shuffled each time the page loads
4. Each image will show with a hover effect revealing project details

## File Naming (Optional)
For better organization, you can name your files with descriptive names:
- `video-editing-project-1.jpg`
- `logo-design-branding.png`
- `computer-repair-before-after.jpg`

## Image Recommendations
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 works best
- **Size**: 800x600px minimum, 1920x1080px maximum
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

## Adding Project Details
You can customize the project details by editing the `portfolioData` array in the main JavaScript file (index.html).
